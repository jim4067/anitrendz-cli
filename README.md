## Description

rewriting the cli app since the [anitiop api](https://anitop.vercel.app/) api broke. The code for the previous app can be found under the [v1-anitop](https://github.com/jim4067/anitrendz-cli/tree/v1-anitop) branch

## Project setup

## Why Update It
The previous version used an api that also scrapped the site but when it went down, well a new source for the data had to be found, hence I decided to scrape anitrendz.net myself.
